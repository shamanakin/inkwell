## Style Rules

**Sentence Structure**:
Long (25-50+ words). Flowing constructions. Can be list-like in cataloging. Nested clauses for scope. Short sentences for contrast. Structure serves expansiveness.

**Jargon Policy**:
Use accessible, inclusive vocabulary. Technical terms when they add scope. Don't exclude through language. Prefer democratic voice.

**Metaphor & Imagery**:
Frequent and inclusive. Detailed imagery that includes everything. Metaphors celebrate diversity. Cataloging through imagery.

**Examples & Stories**:
Extensive examples. Lists and catalogs. Stories that include everything. Examples that show scope.

**Paragraph Length**:
Long, developed paragraphs. Can span pages in cataloging. Shorter for contrast or specific effect.

**Formatting**:
Minimal. Prose does the work. Headers only when structure demands it. Prefer flowing, expansive text.

## Rhythm Constraints

**Punctuation Distribution:**
- Em dashes: Maximum 1-2 per entire chapter/section (HARD CONSTRAINT)
- Use commas, semicolons for cataloging
- Punctuation serves expansiveness

**Structural Variance:**
- Vary between long cataloging and shorter passages
- Rotate between lists and flowing prose
- Avoid formulaic patterns

**Semantic Density:**
- Can be dense with cataloging
- But avoid restating—each item should add scope
- Inclusiveness, not redundancy

---

## Process Preferences

**Before Drafting**:
Plan expansiveness. Know what to include. Plan cataloging and lists.

**During Drafting**:
Build scope and inclusiveness. Check that expansiveness serves, not overwhelms. Verify democratic voice is present.

**Handling Ambiguity**:
Choose inclusiveness. When in doubt, include rather than exclude. Note trade-offs between scope and focus.

## Quality Bar

**Minimum Viable**:
- Expansive but purposeful
- Inclusive voice present
- Cataloging that serves
- Democratic scope present

**Revision Triggers**:
- Limiting when expansiveness serves
- Exclusive rather than inclusive
- Losing democratic voice
- Scope without purpose

**Polish Indicators**:
- Expansiveness rewards attention
- Inclusiveness is palpable
- Cataloging serves scope
- Democratic voice present

## Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Symptom | Self-Check | Correction |
|--------------|---------|------------|------------|
| Overwhelming | Too much, no focus | Does this expansiveness serve? | Add focus while maintaining scope |
| Exclusive | Limiting, not inclusive | Am I excluding unnecessarily? | Add inclusiveness, expand scope |
| Losing voice | Generic expansive prose | Is the democratic voice present? | Add inclusive patterns, democratic language |
| Limiting | Too focused, no scope | Am I losing expansiveness that serves? | Add cataloging, expand scope |
| Em dash overuse | More than 1-2 per chapter | Count em dashes | Replace with other punctuation |
