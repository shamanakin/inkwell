## Style Rules

**Sentence Structure**:
Primarily short (5-15 words). Declarative statements. Occasional longer sentences for contrast. Fragments acceptable and frequent. Avoid ornate constructions.

**Jargon Policy**:
Use precise, direct language. Technical terms when they add edge. Don't soften language. Prefer direct words.

**Metaphor & Imagery**:
Sparse but powerful. Only use imagery that serves edge or meaning. Avoid decorative metaphors. When you use imagery, make it direct and powerful.

**Examples & Stories**:
Direct examples. Stories that have edge. Make points through transgression (when applicable) or directness.

**Paragraph Length**:
Short to medium. Break frequently. White space is part of the rhythm. Longer paragraphs only when building specific effect.

**Formatting**:
Minimal. Let prose do the work. Headers only when structure demands it. Prefer flowing, minimal text.

## Rhythm Constraints

**Punctuation Distribution:**
- Em dashes: Maximum 1-2 per entire chapter/section (HARD CONSTRAINT)
- Prefer periods. Use commas sparingly. Fragments create rhythm.
- Short sentences create natural variance.

**Structural Variance:**
- Vary between short punchy and slightly longer
- Rotate between transgressive and direct
- Avoid formulaic patterns

**Semantic Density:**
- One clear point per sentence/paragraph
- Don't explain what's direct
- Trust the reader

---

## Process Preferences

**Before Drafting**:
Plan minimalism. Know what to cut. Plan edge and directness.

**During Drafting**:
Cut everything that doesn't serve. Ask: is this essential? Can I say this more directly? Trust restraint and edge.

**Handling Ambiguity**:
Choose directness and edge. When in doubt, cut. Less is more. Note what you're leaving for the reader.

## Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Symptom | Self-Check | Correction |
|--------------|---------|------------|------------|
| Over-elaborating | Too much, no minimalism | Can I say this with less? | Cut, compress, direct |
| Softening | Too safe, no edge | Is the edge present? | Add directness, edge |
| Losing power | Minimal but weak | Does minimalism have power? | Add edge, directness |
| Expanding | Too much, no restraint | Am I losing minimalism? | Cut, compress |
| Em dash overuse | More than 1-2 per chapter | Count em dashes | Replace with periods |
