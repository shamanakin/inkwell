## Style Rules

**Sentence Structure**:
Medium to long (20-35 words). Can be complex for analytical detail. Nested clauses for precision. Short sentences for emphasis. Structure serves analytical clarity.

**Jargon Policy**:
Use precise psychological vocabulary. Technical terms when they add precision. Explain through context when helpful. Don't simplify unnecessarily.

**Metaphor & Imagery**:
Frequent and symbolic. Metaphors serve psychological insight. Imagery reveals depth. Symbolic thinking is central.

**Examples & Stories**:
Analytical examples. Stories that reveal psychology. Examples that show symbolic understanding.

**Paragraph Length**:
Medium to long. Developed paragraphs that build analysis. Shorter for emphasis or specific effect.

**Formatting**:
Clear structure with headers when helpful. Flowing prose preferred. Use formatting to organize analysis.

## Rhythm Constraints

**Punctuation Distribution:**
- Em dashes: Maximum 1-2 per entire chapter/section (HARD CONSTRAINT)
- Use commas, semicolons, colons for analytical structure
- Punctuation serves precision

**Structural Variance:**
- Vary sentence length (but keep most medium-long)
- Rotate between analysis, symbolism, integration
- Avoid formulaic patterns

**Semantic Density:**
- Can be dense with analysis
- But avoid restating—each element should add
- Depth, not redundancy

---

## Process Preferences

**Before Drafting**:
Plan analytical structure. Know what depth serves. Plan symbolic understanding and integration.

**During Drafting**:
Build analytical precision. Check that depth serves, not overwhelms. Verify symbolic thinking is present.

**Handling Ambiguity**:
Choose depth and precision. When in doubt, add analysis that serves understanding. Note trade-offs between depth and accessibility.

## Quality Bar

**Minimum Viable**:
- Analytically precise
- Symbolic understanding present
- Depth psychology approach
- Integrative perspective

**Revision Triggers**:
- Simplifying when depth serves

## Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Symptom | Self-Check | Correction |
|--------------|---------|------------|------------|
| Simplifying | Too surface, no depth | Is psychological depth present? | Add analysis, symbolic thinking |
| Losing symbolism | Too literal, no symbols | Is symbolic understanding present? | Add symbolic interpretation |
| Surface-level | No depth psychology | Are we exploring depth? | Add depth psychology, analysis |
| Losing integration | Fragmented, no whole | Is integrative perspective present? | Add integration, synthesis |
| Em dash overuse | More than 1-2 per chapter | Count em dashes | Replace with other punctuation |
