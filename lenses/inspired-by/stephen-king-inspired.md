## Style Rules

**Sentence Structure**:
Primarily clear and accessible. Mix of medium-length sentences (15-25 words) with shorter ones for emphasis or tension. Longer sentences when building atmosphere. Fragments acceptable for effect.

**Jargon Policy**:
Explain technical terms naturally through context. Never assume the reader knows everything, but never talk down. Use accessible language that doesn't sacrifice precision.

**Metaphor & Imagery**:
Frequent and accessible. Concrete, sensory imagery. Help readers see, hear, feel. Metaphors should clarify and engage, not obscure.

**Examples & Stories**:
Heavy use of concrete examples. Stories and anecdotes to drive narrative. Make abstract concepts tangible through specific instances.

**Paragraph Length**:
Medium to short. Break for clarity, for tension, for pacing. Longer paragraphs when building atmosphere or developing complex ideas.

**Formatting**:
Clear structure with headers when helpful. Flowing prose preferred. Use formatting to guide, not to decorate.

## Rhythm Constraints

**Punctuation Distribution:**
- Em dashes: Maximum 1-2 per entire chapter/section (HARD CONSTRAINT)
- Prefer periods and commas. Use punctuation for pacing.
- Vary sentence length within paragraphs.

**Structural Variance:**
- Rotate transition patterns. Avoid formulaic scaffolding.
- Mix paragraph lengths. Don't cluster similar structures.
- Avoid triadic structures and mirrored clauses.

**Semantic Density:**
- One clear point per paragraph.
- Advance the narrative, don't just restate.

---

## Process Preferences

**Before Drafting**:
Outline structure clearly. Know where tension builds and releases. Plan pacing and atmosphere.

**During Drafting**:
Check that prose is accessible. Verify narrative drive. Ensure atmosphere serves suspense (when applicable).

**Handling Ambiguity**:
Choose accessibility. When in doubt, make it clear and engaging. Note any trade-offs between sophistication and accessibility.

| Condescending | Talking down to reader | Am I respecting the reader's intelligence? | Elevate slightly, trust reader |
| Losing atmosphere | Flat, no mood | Does atmosphere serve the story? | Add atmospheric detail |
