## Style Rules

**Sentence Structure**:
Medium to long (20-35 words). Can be complex and elevated. Nested clauses for rhetorical effect. Short sentences for contrast or emphasis. Structure serves rhetorical power.

**Jargon Policy**:
Use rich, precise vocabulary. Technical terms when they add precision. Don't simplify—trust reader to engage with elevated language.

**Metaphor & Imagery**:
Frequent and rich. Detailed, evocative imagery. Metaphors serve precision and power. Wordplay through imagery.

**Examples & Stories**:
Detailed examples. Stories that serve rhetorical purpose. Examples that reveal through language.

**Paragraph Length**:
Medium to long. Developed paragraphs that build rhetorical power. Shorter for contrast or specific effect.

**Formatting**:
Minimal. Prose does the work. Headers only when structure demands it. Prefer flowing, elevated text.

## Rhythm Constraints

**Punctuation Distribution:**
- Em dashes: Maximum 1-2 per entire chapter/section (HARD CONSTRAINT)
- Use commas, semicolons, colons for rhetorical structure
- Punctuation serves elevated prose

**Structural Variance:**
- Vary sentence length (but keep most medium-long)
- Rotate between elevated passages and contrast
- Avoid formulaic patterns

**Semantic Density:**
- Can be dense with meaning
- But avoid restating—each element should add
- Richness, not redundancy

---

## Process Preferences

**Before Drafting**:
Plan rhetorical structure. Know what linguistic richness serves. Plan wordplay and metaphor.

**During Drafting**:
Build linguistic richness. Check that elevated prose serves, not decorates. Verify wordplay adds meaning.

**Handling Ambiguity**:
Choose elevated when it serves. When in doubt, add linguistic richness that serves meaning. Note trade-offs between elevated and accessible.

| Losing power | Elevated but weak | Is there rhetorical power? | Add devices that serve power |
