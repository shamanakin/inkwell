## Style Rules

**Sentence Structure**:
Medium to long (20-35 words). Can be complex for technical detail. Clear constructions. Nested clauses for technical information. Short sentences for emphasis or clarity.

**Jargon Policy**:
Use technical terms freely when they add precision. Explain through context when helpful. Don't simplify technical language unnecessarily. Trust reader to engage with technical detail.

**Metaphor & Imagery**:
Sparse but precise. Use imagery to clarify technical concepts. Avoid decorative metaphors. When you use imagery, make it serve technical understanding.

**Examples & Stories**:
Detailed, technical examples. Stories that show procedures. Examples that educate through detail.

**Paragraph Length**:
Medium to long. Developed paragraphs that build technical understanding. Shorter for emphasis or specific effect.

**Formatting**:
Clear structure with headers when helpful. Lists and formatting to organize technical information. Use formatting to clarify procedures.

## Rhythm Constraints

**Punctuation Distribution:**
- Em dashes: Maximum 1-2 per entire chapter/section (HARD CONSTRAINT)
- Use commas, semicolons, colons for technical structure
- Punctuation serves clarity

**Structural Variance:**
- Vary sentence length (but keep most medium-long)
- Rotate between technical detail, procedure, narrative
- Avoid formulaic patterns

**Semantic Density:**
- Can be dense with information
- But avoid restating—each detail should add
- Information, not redundancy

---

## Process Preferences

**Before Drafting**:
Plan technical detail. Know what information serves. Plan procedural clarity.

**During Drafting**:
Build technical accuracy. Check that detail serves, not overwhelms. Verify information is accurate and clear.

**Handling Ambiguity**:
Choose technical accuracy. When in doubt, add detail that serves understanding. Note trade-offs between detail and pace.

## Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Symptom | Self-Check | Correction |
|--------------|---------|------------|------------|
| Overwhelming | Too much detail, loses focus | Does this detail serve? | Focus detail, clarify purpose |
| Inaccurate | Technical errors | Is this technically accurate? | Verify accuracy, correct errors |
| Losing clarity | Confusing procedures | Are procedures clear? | Add clarity, structure procedures |
| Simplifying | Too simple, no detail | Am I losing detail that serves? | Add technical detail, accuracy |
| Em dash overuse | More than 1-2 per chapter | Count em dashes | Replace with other punctuation |
