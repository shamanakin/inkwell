# Inspired By: Literary Style Lenses

This directory contains lenses inspired by distinctive literary voices. These lenses capture the essential stylistic elements of each author's approach—their sentence rhythms, structural patterns, and rhetorical moves—without directly mimicking their work.

**How to Use:**
- Stack these lenses with domain or format lenses (e.g., "Hemingway-inspired + technical writing")
- These are stylistic templates, not content templates
- Adjust to your own voice and subject matter
- Remember: inspired by, not copying

**Note on Rhythm Constraints:**
All lenses inherit the rhythm constraints from Night's core lens (em dash limits, pattern variance, etc.). These stylistic inspirations work within those constraints.

*These lenses are for stylistic inspiration. Use them to understand how different voices work, then adapt to your own.*
