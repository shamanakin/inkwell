## Style Rules

**Sentence Structure**:
Primarily clear and accessible. Mix of medium-length sentences (15-25 words) with shorter ones for urgency. Longer sentences when reflecting. Fragments acceptable for effect.

**Jargon Policy**:
Explain terms naturally through context. Use accessible language. Technical terms when they add precision, but always with context.

**Metaphor & Imagery**:
Frequent and accessible. Concrete, vivid imagery. Help readers see and feel. Metaphors should clarify and engage.

**Examples & Stories**:
Heavy use of concrete examples. Stories that drive narrative. Make abstract concepts tangible.

**Paragraph Length**:
Medium to short. Break for urgency, for emphasis, for pacing. Longer paragraphs when reflecting or developing themes.

**Formatting**:
Clear structure with headers when helpful. Flowing prose preferred. Use formatting to guide through urgency.

## Rhythm Constraints

**Punctuation Distribution:**
- Em dashes: Maximum 1-2 per entire chapter/section (HARD CONSTRAINT)
- Prefer periods and commas. Use punctuation for urgency.
- Vary sentence length within paragraphs.

**Structural Variance:**
- Rotate transition patterns. Avoid formulaic scaffolding.
- Mix paragraph lengths. Don't cluster similar structures.
- Avoid triadic structures and mirrored clauses.

**Semantic Density:**
- One clear point per paragraph.
- Advance narrative urgently, don't just restate.

## Process Preferences

**Before Drafting**:

**During Drafting**:

## Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Symptom | Self-Check | Correction |
|--------------|---------|------------|------------|
| Losing pace | Too slow, no urgency | Does urgency drive forward? | Add pacing, build urgency |
| Overly complex | Inaccessible, confusing | Can a thoughtful reader follow this? | Simplify, add clarity |
| Losing immediacy | Too distant, no engagement | Is immediacy present? | Add urgency, immediacy |
| Flat | No drive, no engagement | Are both present? | Add pacing and engagement |
| Em dash overuse | More than 1-2 per chapter | Count em dashes | Replace with periods/commas |
