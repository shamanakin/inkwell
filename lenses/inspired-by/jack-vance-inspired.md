**Formatting**:
Minimal. Prose does the work. Headers only when structure demands it. Prefer flowing, ornate text.

## Rhythm Constraints

**Punctuation Distribution:**
- Em dashes: Maximum 1-2 per entire chapter/section (HARD CONSTRAINT)
- Use commas, semicolons, colons for complex structure
- Elegant punctuation serves ornate prose

**Structural Variance:**
- Vary sentence length (but keep most medium-long)
- Rotate between description, dialogue, narrative
- Avoid formulaic patterns

**Semantic Density:**
- Can be dense with detail
- But avoid restating—each detail should add
- Richness, not redundancy

---

## Process Preferences

**Before Drafting**:
Plan elaborate descriptions. Know what details matter. Plan world-building through language.

**During Drafting**:
Build detail and atmosphere. Check that elaborate prose serves, not decorates. Verify vocabulary is precise, not pretentious.

**Handling Ambiguity**:
Choose elaborate when it serves. When in doubt, add detail that builds world or atmosphere. Note trade-offs between ornate and clear.
