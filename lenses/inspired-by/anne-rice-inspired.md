## Style Rules

**Sentence Structure**:
Medium to long (20-35 words). Can be flowing and elaborate. Nested clauses for complexity. Short sentences for contrast. Fragments rare unless for specific effect.

**Jargon Policy**:
Use rich, evocative vocabulary. Technical terms when they add precision. Don't simplify—trust reader to engage with lush prose.

**Metaphor & Imagery**:
Frequent and lush. Detailed, evocative imagery. Metaphors build atmosphere. Sensory detail is essential.

**Examples & Stories**:
Detailed examples. Stories that build atmosphere. Examples that reveal psychology. Rich, immersive detail.

**Paragraph Length**:
Medium to long. Developed paragraphs that build atmosphere. Shorter for contrast or specific effect.

**Formatting**:
Minimal. Prose does the work. Headers only when structure demands it. Prefer flowing, atmospheric text.

## Rhythm Constraints

**Punctuation Distribution:**
- Em dashes: Maximum 1-2 per entire chapter/section (HARD CONSTRAINT)
- Use commas, semicolons for flowing prose
- Punctuation serves atmosphere

**Structural Variance:**
- Vary sentence length (but keep most medium-long)
- Rotate between description, interiority, action
- Avoid formulaic patterns

**Semantic Density:**
- Can be dense with detail
- But avoid restating—each detail should add atmosphere
- Richness, not redundancy

---

## Process Preferences

**Before Drafting**:
Plan atmosphere and mood. Know what details build atmosphere. Plan psychological depth.

**During Drafting**:
Build atmosphere through detail. Check that lush prose serves, not decorates. Verify psychological depth is present.

**Handling Ambiguity**:
Choose lush when it serves atmosphere. When in doubt, add detail that builds mood. Note trade-offs between atmosphere and pace.

## Quality Bar

- Atmospheric and mood-driven
- Lush but purposeful

**Revision Triggers**:

## Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Symptom | Self-Check | Correction |
|--------------|---------|------------|------------|
| Losing atmosphere | Flat, no mood | Is the atmosphere present? | Add mood, sensory detail |
| Decorative detail | Lush without purpose | Does this detail serve? | Cut decorative, keep atmospheric |
| No psychological depth | Surface-level | Are we inside the character's mind? | Add interiority, psychology |
| Rushing | No time for atmosphere | Am I rushing when mood needs time? | Slow down, build atmosphere |
| Em dash overuse | More than 1-2 per chapter | Count em dashes | Replace with other punctuation |
