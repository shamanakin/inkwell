## Style Rules

**Sentence Structure**:
Primarily clear and accessible. Mix of medium-length sentences (15-25 words) with shorter ones for tension. Longer sentences when exploring philosophy. Fragments acceptable for effect.

**Jargon Policy**:
Explain technical terms naturally through context. Use accessible language that doesn't sacrifice precision. Philosophical terms when they serve depth.

**Metaphor & Imagery**:
Frequent and accessible. Concrete, sensory imagery. Help readers see, hear, feel. Metaphors serve both clarity and depth.

**Examples & Stories**:
Heavy use of concrete examples. Stories that drive narrative while exploring themes. Make abstract concepts tangible.

**Paragraph Length**:
Medium to short. Break for tension, for pacing. Longer paragraphs when exploring philosophy or developing themes.

**Formatting**:
Clear structure with headers when helpful. Flowing prose preferred. Use formatting to guide through suspense.

## Rhythm Constraints

**Punctuation Distribution:**
- Em dashes: Maximum 1-2 per entire chapter/section (HARD CONSTRAINT)
- Prefer periods and commas. Use punctuation for pacing.
- Vary sentence length within paragraphs.

**Structural Variance:**
- Rotate transition patterns. Avoid formulaic scaffolding.
- Mix paragraph lengths. Don't cluster similar structures.
- Avoid triadic structures and mirrored clauses.

**Semantic Density:**
- One clear point per paragraph.
- Advance narrative and meaning, don't just restate.

## Process Preferences

**Before Drafting**:
Plan pacing and philosophy. Know where tension builds and where reflection happens. Plan balance of action and depth.

**During Drafting**:
Check that pacing serves suspense. Verify philosophical depth is present. Ensure balance of action and reflection.

**Handling Ambiguity**:
Choose accessibility with depth. When in doubt, maintain pace while adding meaning. Note trade-offs between suspense and philosophy.

## Failure Modes

|--------------|---------|------------|------------|
| Losing pace | Too slow, no tension | Does suspense drive forward? | Add pacing, build tension |
| Philosophy without action | Too reflective, no drive | Is there narrative momentum? | Add action, maintain depth |
| Losing depth | Too fast, no meaning | Does philosophy add meaning? | Add depth, maintain pace |
| Flat | No tension, no depth | Are both present? | Add suspense and philosophy |
| Em dash overuse | More than 1-2 per chapter | Count em dashes | Replace with periods/commas |
