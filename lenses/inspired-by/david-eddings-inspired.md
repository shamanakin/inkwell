## Style Rules

**Sentence Structure**:
Primarily clear and accessible. Mix of medium-length sentences (15-25 words) with shorter ones for emphasis. Longer sentences when building epic scope. Fragments rare unless for specific effect.

**Jargon Policy**:
Explain terms naturally through context. Use accessible language. Technical terms when they add precision, but always with context.

**Metaphor & Imagery**:
Frequent and accessible. Concrete, vivid imagery. Help readers see and feel. Metaphors should clarify, not obscure.

**Examples & Stories**:
Heavy use of concrete examples. Stories that drive narrative. Make abstract concepts tangible through specific instances.

**Paragraph Length**:
Medium to short. Break for clarity, for emphasis, for pacing. Longer paragraphs when building epic scope or developing complex ideas.

**Formatting**:
Clear structure with headers when helpful. Flowing prose preferred. Use formatting to guide through epic scope.

## Rhythm Constraints

**Punctuation Distribution:**
- Em dashes: Maximum 1-2 per entire chapter/section (HARD CONSTRAINT)
- Prefer periods and commas. Use punctuation for clarity.
- Vary sentence length within paragraphs.

**Structural Variance:**
- Rotate transition patterns. Avoid formulaic scaffolding.
- Mix paragraph lengths. Don't cluster similar structures.
- Avoid triadic structures and mirrored clauses.

**Semantic Density:**
- One clear point per paragraph.
- Advance narrative clearly, don't just restate.

## Process Preferences

**Before Drafting**:
Plan clear structure. Know where story progresses. Plan character development and epic scope.

**During Drafting**:
Check that structure is clear. Verify accessibility. Ensure epic scope doesn't confuse.

**Handling Ambiguity**:
Choose clarity. When in doubt, make it accessible. Note trade-offs between epic scope and clarity.
