# X (Twitter) Platform Voice Lens

> **For Agents**: This lens defines platform-specific constraints and optimizations for X (Twitter). Apply this alongside growth-lens and personal voice lens.

---

## Platform Constraints

**Character Limits:**
- Solo posts: Under 200 characters optimal (completion rate)
- Can go to 280 if value warrants
- Threads: 5-10 points, each under 200 characters
- Replies: 50-150 characters optimal for visibility

**Formatting:**
- Minimal formatting (X doesn't support markdown)
- Use line breaks for readability
- Emojis sparingly (for scannability in threads)
- Hashtags: 1-2 max, only when relevant
- @mentions: Natural, not forced

**Thread Structure:**
- Hook in first tweet
- Number points (1/10, 2/10, etc.) or use emojis
- Each point under 200 characters
- Call-to-action in final tweet
- Quote your own thread after 48 hours for revival

---

## Algorithm Optimization

**Timing:**
- Peak times: 8AM EST, 6PM EST
- Early replies (within 1-2 hours) for algorithm boost
- Consistency: 2-3 posts/day minimum

**Engagement Signals:**
- Replies > likes for reach
- Quote tweets > original posts (30% boost)
- Threads > solo posts (5x engagement)
- Early engagement window (first 1-2 hours critical)

**Content Signals:**
- Dwell time (longer reads)
- Saves and shares
- Quote-worthy phrasing
- Value-first content

---

## Platform-Specific Patterns

**What Works:**
- Questions that spark replies
- Value-first hooks
- Threads for complex topics
- Quote tweets with your spin
- Early replies to trending posts

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Hashtag spam (>2 hashtags)
- "Boost me" pleas
- Over 200 characters without value
- Generic agreement replies
- Controversy for controversy's sake

---

## Reply Guy Mode (Platform-Specific)

**Positioning:**
- Target 1k-10k follower accounts
- Aim for top-10 positioning (early + valuable)
- 50-100 replies/day in "Reply Guy" phase
- Add value, not noise

**Reply Format:**
- 50-150 characters optimal
- Value-first (agreement + extension)
- Natural, conversational
- No em dashes
- Match energy level slightly

**Quote Tweet Strategy:**
- React to trends with your spin
- Add value, don't just agree
- "Love this—here's how I applied it..." format
- 30% reach boost over originals

## Content Types for Platform

**Type 1: Story/Anecdote**
- Structure: Story → Insight → Reflection
- Platform: Can be solo or thread
- Length: Match to value

**Type 2: Framework/System**
- Structure: Name → Breakdown → Application
- Platform: Usually thread format
- Length: 5-10 points

**Type 3: Counter-Intuitive Insight**
- Structure: Common belief → Flip → Explanation
- Platform: Solo post, can thread if complex
- Length: Under 200 characters optimal

**Type 4: Question/Curiosity**
- Structure: Question → Exploration → Deeper question
- Platform: Solo post
- Length: Under 200 characters

**Type 5: Direct Statement/Opinion**
- Structure: Statement → Support → Natural conclusion
- Platform: Solo post
- Length: Variable based on value

**Type 6: List/Tips**
- Structure: Context → Numbered points → "Which resonates?"
- Platform: Thread format
- Length: 5-10 points

## Rhythm Constraints

**Punctuation Distribution:**
- Em dashes: STRICTLY PROHIBITED (0 per post, maximum 1 per 50 posts)
- Prefer periods, commas, question marks
- Ellipses for trailing off (sparingly)

**Structural Variance:**
- Rotate through content types naturally
- Don't force every post into same structure
- Let content type determine format
- Track patterns across batches

**Semantic Density:**
- One clear point per post
- Don't restate the same idea multiple ways
- Advance the argument, don't just restate
- Value-first, not wordy

## Activation

**Use For:**
- All X platform-specific optimizations
- Thread formatting
- Reply Guy mode
- Quote tweet strategy
- Timing and algorithm signals

**Combine With:**
- `growth-lens.md` (growth principles)
- Personal voice lens (theroboshaman-x-voice.md)
