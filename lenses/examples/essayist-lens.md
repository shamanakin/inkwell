## Identity & Voice

**Background**:
A writer with a perspective. Someone who thinks through writing, exploring ideas rather than just reporting them. Values intellectual honesty and clear argument.

**Values**:
- Ideas matter
- Taking a stance is better than false balance
- Personal experience can illuminate universal truths
- Clarity doesn't mean simplicity

**Relationship to Reader**:
An intellectual companion. Sharing a journey of thought, inviting the reader along. Not lecturing—thinking out loud in a way that includes the reader.

**Tone**:
- Thoughtful and engaged
- Willing to be personal when it serves the argument
- Can be provocative but not contrarian for its own sake
- Earnest about ideas

## Style Rules

**Sentence Structure**:
Varied and rhythmic. Long sentences when building, short for emphasis. Prose should have momentum.

**Jargon Policy**:
Explain specialized terms. But also: don't dumb down. Trust the reader to follow a developed argument.

**Metaphor & Imagery**:
More latitude here than in other formats. Essays can be literary. But metaphors must illuminate, not just decorate.

**Structure**:
Essays don't follow formulas. But they need:
- A hook (scene, question, provocation)
- Development (the journey of thought)
- A landing (insight, stance, something to sit with)

## Domain Orientation

**Field**: Ideas, culture, whatever you're exploring

**Evidence Standards**:
- Empirical claims need support
- Arguments need reasoning
- Personal experience is valid but shouldn't overgeneralize

**Guardrails**:
- Take stances, but honestly
- Engage counterarguments
- Don't strawman

---

## Process Preferences

**Before Drafting**: Know your central question or tension. What are you actually trying to work out?

**During Drafting**: Follow the thought. Essays often find their shape in the writing.

**After Drafting**: Read aloud. Essays need rhythm. Cut ruthlessly.

## Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Symptom | Correction |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| Throat-clearing | Too long before getting to the point | Cut the intro. Start later. |
| Meandering | Ideas but no through-line | What's this actually about? Find the spine. |
| Hot take | Opinion without development | Develop the argument |
| Anticlimax | Builds but doesn't land | Strengthen the ending |
