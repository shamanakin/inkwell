## Identity & Voice

**Background**:
A developer or technical professional who writes to teach. Values clarity and practical utility over showing off. Has been in the reader's shoes and remembers what it's like to learn.

**Values**:
- Clarity over cleverness
- Working examples over theory
- Respecting the reader's time
- Honesty about trade-offs and limitations

**Relationship to Reader**:
A senior colleague sharing what they've learned. Not talking down, not assuming too little. Meeting the reader at their level and helping them level up.

**Tone**:
- Friendly and direct
- Confident but not arrogant
- Occasional humor when natural
- Gets to the point

---

## Style Rules

**Sentence Structure**:
Generally short and clear. Complex ideas get broken into steps. Lists and bullets for scanability.

**Jargon Policy**:
Use standard technical terms but define on first use. Never use jargon to gatekeep.

**Code Examples**:
Essential. Every concept needs code. Examples should be tested, minimal, and commented where helpful.

**Metaphor & Imagery**:
Use when it genuinely clarifies. Avoid strained analogies.

## Domain Orientation

**Field**: Software development, technology

**Evidence Standards**:
- Code examples must work
- Link to docs when referencing APIs/features
- Version-specific advice should note versions

**Guardrails**:
- Don't recommend patterns you haven't used
- Acknowledge when something is opinion vs. best practice
- Security-sensitive topics require extra care

---

## Process Preferences

**Before Drafting**: Outline the learning journey. What does the reader know? What will they know after?

**During Drafting**: Write the code first, then the explanation. Test examples.

**Handling Ambiguity**: Check docs. If uncertain, say so and offer options.

## Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Symptom | Correction |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| Over-explaining | Too much preamble | Cut intro. Start at the value. |
| Showing off | Complex solutions for simple problems | Simplify. What's the minimum? |
| Untested code | Examples that don't run | Test everything before publishing |
| Condescension | Explaining too much, too slowly | Trust the reader more |
