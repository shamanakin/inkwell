# Context Loading Manifest

> **For Agents**: This document specifies what to load and in what order when working on this project. Load Tier 1 files always. Load Tier 2 if context space allows. Tier 3 is reference material for specific needs.

---

## Tier 1 — Always Load

*These files are required for any work session.*

- [ ] `../../AGENT-PLAYBOOK.md` — Behavioral instructions
- [ ] `PROJECT.md` — Project source of truth
- [ ] `[Current Section Card]` — Local context for the task

---

## Tier 2 — Load If Space Allows

*These files provide important context but can be summarized if tight.*

- [ ] `[Primary lens path]` — Main voice and style
- [ ] `[Secondary lens path]` — Domain or format overlay
- [ ] `OUTLINE.md` — Structure and big picture
- [ ] `HANDOFF.md` — Session continuity

---

## Tier 3 — Reference Material

*Load on demand when specific information is needed.*

- [ ] `DECISIONS.md` — Log of past choices
- [ ] `[Adjacent section cards]` — For context on related content
- [ ] `[Additional lenses]` — If specific guidance is needed

---

## When Context Is Tight

If you cannot load everything in Tier 1 and Tier 2:

1. Always load Tier 1 completely
2. For lenses, read at minimum the "Identity & Voice" section
3. Summarize OUTLINE.md rather than reading fully
4. Skip Tier 3 unless specifically relevant
5. If critically constrained, ask the human what to prioritize
