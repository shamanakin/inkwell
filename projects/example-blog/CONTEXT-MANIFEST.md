# Context Loading Manifest — Example Blog

> **For Agents**: Load files in priority order. Always load Tier 1. Load Tier 2 if space allows.

## Tier 1 — Always Load

- [ ] `../../AGENT-PLAYBOOK.md` — Behavioral instructions
- [ ] `PROJECT.md` — Project source of truth
- [ ] `[Current Section Card]` — The specific post you're working on

---

## Tier 2 — Load If Space Allows

- [ ] `[Your lens path]` — Voice and style
- [ ] `OUTLINE.md` — Big picture of planned posts
- [ ] `HANDOFF.md` — Continuity from previous sessions

## Tier 3 — Reference

- [ ] `DECISIONS.md` — Past choices
- [ ] Adjacent section cards — Cross-reference

## When Context Is Tight

1. Always load Tier 1 completely
2. For lenses, read at minimum "Identity & Voice"
3. Summarize OUTLINE.md if you can't load fully
4. Skip Tier 3 unless specifically relevant
