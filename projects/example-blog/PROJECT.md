## Vision

**What**:
A professional blog for [your field]. Posts that establish expertise, build trust with potential clients/readers, and provide genuine value.

**Why**:
- Help people understand what you do and how you think
- Reduce barriers to engagement (hiring, subscribing, reaching out)
- Create a body of work that demonstrates your perspective
- Build an audience over time

**Success Looks Like**:
Someone discovers your blog, reads a few posts, and thinks: "This person knows what they're talking about. I want to hear more from them."

## Audience

**Primary Audience**:

**Secondary Audiences**:
- Peers in your field
- People researching the topic generally

**Reader State**:
Curious. Maybe skeptical. Looking for signal in a noisy space.

**What They Need**:
- Clarity on topics that matter to them
- A sense of your expertise and perspective
- Practical value or new ways of thinking
