## Vision

**What**:
A 5-chapter mini book exploring mismatch theory—the perspective that the majority of human mental health issues are downstream of a mismatch between ancestral wiring/evolutionary drives and contemporary living. This is a concise, accessible exploration of how our evolutionary past collides with modern life, and what that means for understanding mental health.

**Why**:
To offer a coherent framework for understanding mental health that moves beyond pathology and toward seeing symptoms as understandable responses to environmental mismatch. This perspective can be both validating (you're not broken) and empowering (we can address the mismatch).

**Success Looks Like**:
A reader finishes the book with a new lens for understanding their own experience and the mental health landscape more broadly. They feel seen, understood, and equipped with a framework that makes sense of patterns they've noticed but couldn't name.

---

## Audience

**Primary Audience**:
Curious, thoughtful adults who are interested in understanding mental health from a different angle. They may have personal experience with mental health challenges, or they may be helping others. They're open to evolutionary and systems thinking, but don't need deep academic background.

**Secondary Audiences**:
- Clinicians looking for frameworks to share with clients
- People interested in evolutionary psychology and human nature
- Readers seeking alternative perspectives on mental health

**Reader State**:
Likely curious, possibly skeptical of traditional mental health narratives, open to new frameworks. May be carrying some frustration with how mental health is typically discussed (either too medicalized or too dismissive).

**What They Already Know**:
- Basic understanding that humans evolved over time
- Familiarity with the concept that modern life is different from how humans lived for most of history
- General awareness of mental health issues (anxiety, depression, etc.)

**What They Need**:
- A coherent framework for understanding mental health through the lens of mismatch
- Validation that their struggles make sense in context
- Practical implications and pathways forward
- Hope without false promises

## Constraints

**Ethical Constraints**:
- Never suggest that therapy or professional help isn't needed
- Don't oversimplify complex mental health conditions
- Acknowledge that mismatch theory is a lens, not the only truth
- Trauma-informed: assume some readers carry significant pain
- No promises about outcomes or "fixes"

**Factual Constraints**:
- Ground claims in established evolutionary psychology and anthropology when possible
- Acknowledge when something is theoretical vs. empirically supported
- Be honest about the limits of what we know
- Don't invent research or overstate evidence

**Tonal Constraints**:
- Warm but grounded (per Night's voice)
- Accessible but not dumbed down
- Respectful of reader's intelligence
- Direct when clarity matters, gentle when topics are tender

**Scope Boundaries**:
- This is a mini book, not a comprehensive treatise
- Focus on mental health implications, not all aspects of evolutionary mismatch
- Not a self-help manual—more of a framework/exploration
- Won't cover every mental health condition in depth

**Length/Format Constraints**:
- 5 chapters total
- Each chapter should be substantial but digestible (roughly 2000-3000 words per chapter)
- Mini book format: accessible, flowing prose

## Lens Stack

| Priority | Lens | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|------|---------|
| 1 | Night Core Lens | `../private/lenses/night/night-core-lens.md` | Primary voice, values, and writing style |
| 2 | Night Clinical Lens | `../private/lenses/night/night-clinical-lens.md` | Clinical/psychological domain expertise and ethical guardrails |

**Conflict Resolution**:
The core lens defines voice and style. The clinical lens adds domain-specific guidance and ethical considerations. When in doubt about clinical matters, defer to the clinical lens. When in doubt about voice, defer to the core lens.
