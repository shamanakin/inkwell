## Intent

**Purpose**:
Hook the reader, introduce the core idea of mismatch theory, and set clear expectations for what this book will and won't do. Create curiosity and establish the tone.

**Reader Outcome**:
After reading, the reader should:
- Understand the basic premise of mismatch theory
- Feel curious about exploring this perspective
- Have realistic expectations about what the book offers
- Feel invited into a thoughtful exploration rather than sold a solution

**Key Points**:
- Mental health issues are prevalent—why?
- The mismatch hypothesis: what if we're not broken, but misaligned?
- This is a lens, not a cure-all
- What to expect from the book

# Introduction: Setting the Stage for Mismatch Theory

Here's something that doesn't make sense: we live in the most prosperous, connected, technologically advanced era in human history. We have more information, more resources, more ways to connect than ever before. And yet, mental health struggles are everywhere.

Anxiety. Depression. Attention issues. Sleep problems. Relationship struggles. Addictive patterns. The list goes on. These aren't rare experiences—they're common enough that most of us know them personally, either in ourselves or in people we care about.

The question that haunts me, both as a therapist and as someone who thinks about systems, is: why? Why is this happening? Why are so many of us struggling?

The standard answers don't fully satisfy. Yes, there's trauma. Yes, there's genetics. Yes, there's brain chemistry. Yes, there are individual differences. But something feels missing. Something that would explain the scale of what we're seeing.

What if the majority of human mental health issues aren't evidence that we're broken, but evidence that we're misaligned? What if our struggles are downstream of a fundamental mismatch between what we're wired for and the world we actually live in?

This is the core idea we'll explore in this mini book: mismatch theory. The perspective that many of our mental health symptoms make sense when we understand them as responses to an environment that doesn't match our evolutionary design.

I want to be clear about what this book is and isn't.

This book is:
- A framework for understanding mental health through the lens of evolutionary mismatch
- An exploration of how ancestral wiring collides with contemporary living
- A validation that your struggles might make more sense than you've been told
- A pathway toward understanding, if not always easy solutions

This book is not:
- A comprehensive explanation of all mental health issues
- A replacement for therapy or professional support
- A promise that understanding mismatch will fix everything
- A dismissal of other perspectives on mental health

Mismatch theory is a lens, not the only truth. It's one way of seeing things that I've found useful, both in my clinical work and in understanding my own experience. It doesn't explain everything, but it explains enough to be worth exploring.

Here's what we'll do together:

First, we'll look at what we're wired for—the ancestral environment and the core needs that shaped us as a species. This isn't about romanticizing the past, but about understanding the conditions that shaped our design.

Then, we'll examine the world we actually live in—how modern life differs from what we're wired for, and where the specific mismatches occur.

Next, we'll connect the dots: how does this mismatch show up as the symptoms we recognize? How do anxiety, depression, attention issues, and other struggles make sense as responses to misalignment?

Finally, we'll explore what this means—both individually and systemically. What can we do with this framework? How do we navigate a world that doesn't match our wiring?

My hope is that by the end, you'll have a new lens for understanding mental health. Not a cure-all, but a way of seeing that might make your experience—or the experiences of people you care about—feel more understandable, less pathologized, and perhaps more workable.

This is a mini book, not a comprehensive treatise. We're going to move quickly through big ideas. Some things will be simplified. That's intentional—we're building a framework, not writing an academic text.

I'm writing this as a therapist who's seen how useful this perspective can be, but also as someone who's experienced the mismatch myself. I know what it's like to feel like something's wrong with you, only to realize later that maybe the problem isn't entirely you—maybe it's the collision between your wiring and your environment.

So let's begin. Let's explore what happens when ancient wiring meets modern life, and what that might mean for understanding mental health.

## Decisions

[To be added during writing]

---

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should we include specific statistics on mental health prevalence?
- [ ] How much to acknowledge other perspectives upfront?

---

## TODOs

- [ ] Write draft
- [ ] Self-check against lenses
- [ ] Review for tone and engagement

---

## Notes

This introduction sets the entire tone for the book. It needs to be engaging, honest, and inviting. Avoid overselling or making false promises.
