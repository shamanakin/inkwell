# Chapter 1: What We're Wired For

To understand mismatch, we need to start with what we're wired for. Not what we wish we were wired for, or what we think we should be wired for, but what actually shaped us as a species.

Humans evolved over hundreds of thousands of years in conditions that are almost unrecognizable compared to how most of us live now. For the vast majority of our evolutionary history, we lived in small groups, moved with the seasons, and had clear roles within our communities. We were deeply connected to the natural world, to each other, and to rhythms that made sense to our bodies.

This isn't about romanticizing the past—life was hard, dangerous, and often short. But it's important to understand the conditions that shaped our design, because those conditions created expectations that are still built into us.

## The World That Shaped Us

Imagine, for a moment, what life was like for most of human history. You're part of a small group—maybe 50 to 150 people. You know everyone. You know their stories, their families, their roles. You depend on each other for survival, and that dependence creates bonds that are hard to replicate in modern life.

You wake with the sun and sleep when it's dark. Your body moves throughout the day—hunting, gathering, building, traveling. You're outside, connected to weather and seasons. You know where your food comes from because you helped get it. You know where you fit because your role is clear.

This is what evolutionary psychologists call the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, or EEA. It's not a specific time or place, but the general conditions that shaped our species. And while there's variation across cultures and time periods, certain patterns were consistent enough to shape our fundamental wiring.

## Belonging: We're Wired for Connection

Humans are social creatures. This isn't just a nice idea—it's built into our survival. For most of our history, being alone meant death. We needed the group to survive, and that need shaped us deeply.

But it's not just about physical survival. We're wired to belong, to be known, to matter to a group. In ancestral conditions, this happened naturally. You were born into a community, grew up with the same people, and had a place that was yours.

This belonging wasn't abstract—it was concrete. You contributed to the group in ways that were visible and valued. Your role mattered. Your absence would be noticed. You were needed.

Modern life offers connection in quantity but often fails to deliver it in quality. We can have hundreds of "friends" online but feel deeply alone. We can be surrounded by people but not feel seen or needed. The wiring is still there—the need to belong, to be known, to matter—but the conditions that naturally met those needs are often missing.

## Safety: The Need for Predictability and Protection

Safety, in ancestral conditions, was about more than just physical protection—though that was part of it. It was about predictability. You knew the patterns. You knew what to expect from your environment, from the seasons, from the people around you.

Threats were real but finite. A predator, a storm, a conflict with another group—these were immediate and resolvable. Your nervous system could activate, respond, and then return to baseline. The threat passed, and your body knew it.

Modern life offers physical safety in ways our ancestors couldn't imagine, but it creates new forms of uncertainty. Constant information about threats we can't directly address. Economic instability. Social comparison that never ends. The threat system that evolved for immediate, resolvable dangers is now activated by abstract, ongoing concerns.

Your body doesn't know the difference between a saber-toothed cat and a notification about global events. It just knows: threat. And when the threat doesn't resolve—when it's ongoing, abstract, and out of your direct control—your nervous system stays activated. This is the foundation of much of what we call anxiety.

## Meaning: Purpose Through Contribution and Belonging

In ancestral conditions, meaning wasn't something you had to find—it was built into your life. You contributed to the group's survival. You had skills that mattered. You could see the impact of your work. You were part of something larger than yourself, and that participation gave your life purpose.

This wasn't abstract meaning-making. It was concrete: I helped gather food today. I helped build shelter. I helped care for the children. I contributed to the group's well-being, and that contribution was visible and valued.

Modern life often separates us from meaning. We work in systems so large that our contribution feels invisible. We do tasks that don't connect to outcomes we can see. We're told to "find" meaning, as if it's something we lost, when really we're in conditions that don't naturally provide it.

The wiring is still there—the need to contribute, to matter, to be part of something larger. But the conditions that naturally met those needs are often absent.

## Autonomy: Agency Within Interdependence

This might seem contradictory—how can you have autonomy when you're so dependent on the group? But ancestral life offered a particular kind of agency: you had control within your domain, even as you depended on others.

You knew how to do things. You had skills. You could make decisions about your work, your movement, your contribution. You weren't autonomous in the modern individualistic sense, but you had agency within interdependence.

Modern life often offers the opposite: independence without real agency. You can make many choices, but they're often choices between options you didn't create. You have freedom in theory, but less control over the conditions that shape your life.

The wiring is still there—the need for agency, for control, for the ability to affect your world. But modern conditions often create the illusion of choice without the substance of real agency.

## The Body's Expectations: Movement, Nature, Rhythm

Our bodies evolved with specific expectations. They expect movement—not just exercise, but varied, functional movement throughout the day. They expect connection to nature—sunlight, fresh air, natural rhythms. They expect cycles—wake and sleep, activity and rest, seasons that change.

In ancestral conditions, these expectations were naturally met. You moved because you had to. You were outside because that's where life happened. You followed natural rhythms because there was no alternative.

Modern life often violates these expectations. We sit for hours. We're inside, under artificial light. We override natural rhythms with technology and schedules. Our bodies are confused, and that confusion shows up in ways we're only beginning to understand.

Sleep problems. Chronic pain. Attention issues. Regulation difficulties. These aren't just "in your head"—they're responses from a body that's operating in conditions it wasn't designed for.

## What This Wiring Means for Us Today

None of this means we should—or could—return to ancestral conditions. That's not the point. The point is to understand what we're wired for, so we can see where the mismatches occur.

We're wired for:
- Deep, meaningful connection with a small group of people who know us
- Predictable threats that resolve, allowing our nervous system to return to baseline
- Clear roles and contributions that give our lives meaning
- Agency within interdependence—control over our domain while being part of something larger
- Movement, nature, and natural rhythms that our bodies expect

These aren't preferences. They're needs that were built into us over hundreds of thousands of years. And when those needs aren't met—when the conditions don't match the wiring—we experience symptoms.

In the next chapter, we'll look at the world we actually live in, and see where these wires get crossed. But first, it's worth sitting with this: you're not broken. You're wired for conditions that are increasingly rare in modern life. And that wiring is still active, still expecting what it was designed for.

The symptoms you experience might not be evidence of pathology. They might be evidence of a system trying to function in conditions it wasn't designed for.
