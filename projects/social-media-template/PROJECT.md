## Vision

**What**:

**Why**:
To facilitate growth through consistent, value-first content that builds trust and engagement without being combative or salesy.

**Success Looks Like**:
- Consistent posting (2-3x/day)
- 20%+ engagement rate
- Authentic voice maintained
- Natural variation through content
- Growth through value, not controversy

---

## Audience

**Primary Audience**:
X users interested in tech, AI, gaming, therapy, and the intersection of these domains. Thoughtful, tech-savvy, appreciates authentic voice.

**Secondary Audiences**:
- Therapists in private practice
- Tech/AI enthusiasts
- Gamers
- People interested in personal development

**Reader State**:
Scrolling, looking for value. Appreciates authenticity. Doesn't want to be sold to.

## Constraints

**Ethical Constraints**:
- Never be salesy or pushy
- Never be combative or inflammatory
- Always add value
- Maintain authenticity
- Build trust, not just followers

**Tonal Constraints**:
- Authentic TheRoboShaman voice
- Casual but not unprofessional
- Direct, no fluff
- Can be vulnerable, analytical, brief, or longer—depends on content

**Platform Constraints**:
- Under 200 characters optimal (can go to 280)
- No em dashes (HARD CONSTRAINT)
- Content-driven structure
- Natural variation

**Scope Boundaries**:
- Focus on X (Twitter) only
- Batch creation for consistency
- Growth-optimized but authentic
- Value-first always

## Lens Stack

| Priority | Lens | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|------|---------|
| 1 | TheRoboShaman X Voice | `../private/lenses/theroboshaman-x-voice.md` | Authentic personal voice |
| 2 | Growth Lens | `../lenses/social-media/growth-lens.md` | Growth principles and optimization |
| 3 | X Platform Voice | `../lenses/social-media/x-twitter-voice.md` | Platform-specific constraints |

**Conflict Resolution**:
Personal voice defines tone and style. Growth lens adds optimization. Platform lens adds constraints. When in doubt about voice, defer to personal voice. When in doubt about growth, defer to growth lens.
