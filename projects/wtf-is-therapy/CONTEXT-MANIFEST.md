# Context Loading Manifest — What the Fuck is Therapy?

> **For Agents**: Load files in priority order. Always load Tier 1. Load Tier 2 if space allows.

---

## Tier 1 — Always Load

- [ ] `../../AGENT-PLAYBOOK.md` — Behavioral instructions
- [ ] `PROJECT.md` — Project source of truth
- [ ] `[Current Section Card]` — The specific chapter/section you're working on

---

## Tier 2 — Load If Space Allows

- [ ] `../private/lenses/night/night-core-lens.md` — Primary voice and style
- [ ] `../private/lenses/night/night-clinical-lens.md` — Clinical expertise and guardrails
- [ ] `OUTLINE.md` — Full book structure
- [ ] `HANDOFF.md` — Continuity from previous sessions (when it exists)

---

## Tier 3 — Reference

- [ ] `DECISIONS.md` — Past choices (when it exists)
- [ ] Adjacent section cards — Cross-reference for flow
- [ ] `../../../Database/_core/identity.md` — Author identity context
- [ ] `../../../Database/_core/therapeutic_framework.md` — Clinical framework grounding

---

## When Context Is Tight

1. Always load Tier 1 completely
2. For lenses, read at minimum "Identity & Voice" sections
3. Summarize OUTLINE.md if you can't load fully
4. Skip Tier 3 unless specifically relevant to current chapter

## Project-Specific Notes

- This book has a strong personal voice—prioritize the core lens over clinical lens when voice conflicts arise
- The book is permission-giving; agents should not hedge excessively or add disclaimers that undercut the direct tone
- Cross-reference `Database/creative/ontologic_shock_themes.md` if exploring the "systems are honest, people aren't" angle
