## Document Structure

**File Location**: `WRITING/InkWell Test/Cognitive Offloading - A Primer.md`

**Format**: Single Markdown file with all content, ready for direct export to print/PDF formats.

---

## Heading Hierarchy

**Level 1 (Title)**: 
```
# Cognitive Offloading: A Primer
```
- Single `#` for main title
- No other Level 1 headings in document

**Level 2 (Part Titles)**:
```
## Part I: The Mechanisms
```
- Use `##` for major parts
- Format: `## Part [Roman Numeral]: [Title]`

**Level 3 (Chapter Titles)**:
```
### Chapter 1: The Infrastructure of Offloading
```
- Use `###` for chapters
- Format: `### Chapter [Number]: [Title]`
- Always include chapter number

**Level 4 (Section Headings)**:
```
#### The Smartphone: Your Brain in Your Pocket
```
- Use `####` for major sections within chapters
- No numbering needed

**Level 5 (Subsections)**:
```
##### External Memory vs. Internal Memory
```
- Use `#####` for subsections
- Use sparingly, only when needed for clarity

**No Level 6 or below** - keep structure clear and not overly nested.

---

## Spacing and Layout

**Between Major Sections**:
- One blank line between paragraphs
- Two blank lines before Level 2 (Parts)
- Two blank lines before Level 3 (Chapters)
- One blank line before Level 4 (Sections)
- One blank line before Level 5 (Subsections)

**Paragraphs**:
- Single blank line between paragraphs
- No indentation (standard Markdown)
- No extra spacing within paragraphs

**Block Quotes**:
- Use `>` for quoted material or emphasized passages
- Single blank line before and after block quotes
- Format:
```
> This is a block quote that emphasizes a key point or contains quoted material.
```

---

## Text Formatting

**Emphasis**:
- Use `**bold**` for strong emphasis (sparingly)
- Use `*italic*` for subtle emphasis or technical terms on first use
- Avoid excessive formatting - let the prose carry weight

**Lists**:
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps or ordered points
- Use bullet lists for unordered items
- Single blank line before lists
- Single blank line after lists
- Indent list items with 2 spaces (Markdown standard)

**Code/Technical Terms**:
- Use backticks for technical terms, platform names, or specific technologies: `algorithm`, `smartphone`, `social media platform`
- No backticks for general concepts: empathy, memory, identity

---

## Chapter Transitions

**Between Chapters**:
- End each chapter with a natural conclusion
- Two blank lines
- Next chapter heading
- One blank line
- Begin chapter content

**Between Parts**:
- End part with natural conclusion
- Three blank lines
- Part heading
- Two blank lines
- Begin first chapter of new part

---

## Special Elements

**Examples and Case Studies**:
- Integrate naturally into prose
- If a longer example, use block quote format
- No special formatting markers needed

**Key Concepts**:
- Bold on first significant use: **cognitive offloading**
- After first use, use normal text
- Define clearly on first use

**Cross-References**:
- Avoid explicit "see Chapter X" references
- Instead, use natural transitions: "As we explored earlier..." or "We'll return to this..."

---

## Consistency Rules

**Numbers**:
- Spell out one through nine
- Use numerals for 10 and above
- Use numerals for percentages: 75 percent (or 75% if in context)
- Use numerals for years: 2025

**Quotations**:
- Use standard quotation marks: "quoted text"
- For quotes within quotes: 'single quotes'
- Block quotes for longer passages (3+ sentences)

**Platform/Technology Names**:
- Use proper capitalization: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google
- Use backticks for technical terms: `algorithm`, `API`, `machine learning`
- Be consistent with naming (e.g., "social media" vs. "social platforms" - pick one and stick with it)

**For Web/HTML**:
- Markdown converts cleanly to HTML
- All formatting will be preserved

**For Word/Docx**:
- Most Markdown converters handle this structure well
- May need minor tweaks for spacing in Word
