# Context Manifest

Priority order for loading context when working on this project.

---

## Tier 1 — Always Load

1. `AGENT-PLAYBOOK.md` (from inkwell root)
2. `PROJECT.md` (this project's source of truth)
3. Current Section Card (from `sections/`)

---

## Tier 2 — Load If Space

4. `OUTLINE.md` (overall structure)
5. `HANDOFF.md` (session continuity)
6. Active lens files:
   - `../private/lenses/night/night-core-lens.md`
   - `../private/lenses/night/night-clinical-lens.md`
   - `../private/lenses/night/night-essay-lens.md`

---

## Tier 3 — Reference

7. `DECISIONS.md` (significant choices made)
8. Adjacent section cards (for continuity)
9. User-provided examples (empathy erosion, intrapersonal coherence, moral inflation, groupthink)

---

## Notes

- When drafting, prioritize loading the current section card and relevant lens files
- When outlining or planning, prioritize `OUTLINE.md` and `PROJECT.md`
- User examples about empathy, coherence, moral inflation, and groupthink should inform Chapters 4, 5, 6, and 8
