## 2025-01-27 — Project Structure and Scope

**Context**: Initial project setup and outline development

**Decision**: 
- Structure as a comprehensive primer (35,000-50,000 words)
- Organize into four major parts: Mechanisms, Individual Degradation, Collective Degradation, Reclamation
- Use ACT principles implicitly (not explicitly labeled)
- Focus on cognitive offloading specifically, not all technology effects

**Rationale**:
- The topic requires substantial exploration to do it justice
- The four-part structure provides clear progression: what it is → how it works → individual impact → collective impact → what to do
- ACT principles work well for this topic but labeling them explicitly might feel too clinical or prescriptive
- Narrowing to cognitive offloading specifically keeps the focus clear and manageable
