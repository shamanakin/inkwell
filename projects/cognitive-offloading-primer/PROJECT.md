## Vision

**What**:
A comprehensive primer on cognitive offloading—what it is, how it's degrading humanity at both individual and collective levels, and how to work against it using a non-explicit ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) approach. This is a deep exploration of how we're outsourcing our cognitive capacities to technology and systems, and the profound consequences of that shift.

**Why**:
Cognitive offloading is a phenomenon that many people sense but few fully understand. It's showing up everywhere—in how we think, how we relate, how we regulate ourselves, and how we maintain identity. This primer aims to name it, map it, and offer pathways for reclamation. The goal is to help readers recognize what's happening and develop practices to maintain their own cognitive capacities.

**Success Looks Like**:
A reader finishes this primer with:
- A clear understanding of what cognitive offloading is and how it manifests
- Recognition of how it's affecting them personally
- Awareness of the broader societal implications
- Practical, ACT-informed strategies for working against it
- A sense of agency rather than despair

## Audience

**Primary Audience**:
Thoughtful adults who are noticing something feels off about how we're living, thinking, and relating in the digital age. They may have sensed that something is degrading but haven't had the language or framework to understand it. They're open to psychological and systems thinking, and they want both understanding and practical pathways forward.

**Secondary Audiences**:
- Clinicians looking for frameworks to help clients navigate digital-age challenges
- People interested in technology's impact on human psychology
- Readers concerned about societal trends and collective well-being

**Reader State**:
Likely carrying some unease or concern about modern life, but may not have fully articulated it. Possibly feeling overwhelmed, disconnected, or noticing their own cognitive capacities weakening. Open to challenging perspectives but not looking for simple scapegoating.

**What They Already Know**:
- Basic awareness that technology is changing how we live
- Some familiarity with concepts like attention spans, social media effects
- General understanding that something feels different about modern life

**What They Need**:
- A coherent framework for understanding cognitive offloading
- Recognition of how it manifests in their own life
- Understanding of the broader implications
- Practical, actionable strategies (ACT-informed but not explicitly labeled)
- Hope and agency, not just critique

## Constraints

**Ethical Constraints**:
- Never suggest that technology is inherently evil or that we should reject it entirely
- Don't pathologize normal adaptation to new environments
- Acknowledge that some offloading is beneficial and necessary
- Don't shame readers for their current patterns
- Trauma-informed: assume some readers are using technology to cope with real pain
- Never suggest that therapy or professional help isn't needed

**Factual Constraints**:
- Ground claims in established research when possible
- Acknowledge when something is theoretical vs. empirically supported
- Be honest about the limits of what we know
- Don't invent research or overstate evidence
- Distinguish between correlation and causation appropriately

**Tonal Constraints**:
- Warm but grounded (per Night's voice)
- Direct about problems without being alarmist
- Empowering rather than despairing
- Respectful of reader's intelligence
- Avoid both techno-optimism and techno-pessimism—aim for clear-eyed realism

**Scope Boundaries**:
- Focus on cognitive offloading specifically, not all technology effects
- Individual and collective levels, but not exhaustive coverage of either
- ACT approach should be implicit, not explicitly labeled as "ACT"
- Not a comprehensive self-help manual—more of a framework with practical elements
- Won't cover every manifestation of offloading in depth

**Length/Format Constraints**:
- Length should be sufficient to fully explore the topic (likely 15,000-25,000 words)
- Primer format: accessible but substantial
- Can be structured as chapters or major sections
- Should feel complete, not rushed

## Lens Stack

| Priority | Lens | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|------|---------|
| 1 | Night Core Lens | `../private/lenses/night/night-core-lens.md` | Primary voice, values, and writing style |
| 2 | Night Clinical Lens | `../private/lenses/night/night-clinical-lens.md` | Clinical/psychological domain expertise and ethical guardrails |
| 3 | Night Essay Lens | `../private/lenses/night/night-essay-lens.md` | Long-form exploratory writing, argument development |

**Conflict Resolution**:
The core lens defines voice and style. The clinical lens adds domain-specific guidance and ethical considerations. The essay lens allows for more argumentative and exploratory writing. When in doubt about clinical matters, defer to the clinical lens. When in doubt about voice, defer to the core lens. When developing arguments, use the essay lens.
