**Completed**:
- Project structure created (`PROJECT.md`)

- Complete book written: `WRITING/InkWell Test/Cognitive Offloading - A Primer.md`
- All chapters completed following outline structure
- Formatting follows print-ready standards (headings, spacing, structure)

**Decisions Made**:
- Structure as comprehensive primer (approximately 40,000 words)
- Four-part organization: Mechanisms, Individual Degradation, Collective Degradation, Reclamation
- ACT principles implicit throughout Part IV, not explicitly labeled
- Focus specifically on cognitive offloading
- Single markdown file for final output, copy/paste ready
- Formatting guide tailored to this project for publication readiness

**Open Questions**:
- None—book is complete and ready for review

**Next Step**:
- User reviews complete book
- Ready for publication/export to desired format

**Context Notes**:
- User provided excellent starting material about empathy erosion, intrapersonal coherence, moral inflation, and groupthink
- These examples informed specific chapters (Chapter 6 on empathy, Chapter 4 on discernment, Chapter 8 on moral inflation)
- Book follows Night's voice through all three lenses (core, clinical, essay)
- Formatting is print-ready with proper heading hierarchy and spacing
- All content is in single markdown file for easy export
