# Social Media Writing Session Prompt

Copy and paste this into Cursor to start a social media content creation session:

---

I'm working on a social media content project using InkWell. Load the social media project template and help me create batch posts for X (Twitter).

**Project Location**: `projects/social-media-template/`

**Active Lenses**:
1. `private/lenses/theroboshaman-x-voice.md` (personal voice)
2. `lenses/social-media/growth-lens.md` (growth principles)
3. `lenses/social-media/x-twitter-voice.md` (platform optimization)

**This Session I Will**:
[Describe what you want to create - batch posts, reply to a post, etc.]

---

## For Reply Guy Mode (Quick Reply - No File Creation)

If you want to generate a reply, just say:

**Reply Guy Mode** or **inkwell social media mode**

[Paste post text or describe the post you want to reply to]

The agent will:
- Load your personal voice lens and growth lens
- Generate 3-5 reply variations
- Output replies directly in chat (conversational, no file creation)
- No project structure needed unless you explicitly want tracking

*Follow the InkWell agent playbook. Load context, do pre-flight check, execute, self-check, update state.*
