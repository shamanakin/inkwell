## Instructions for this session

You are working inside the InkWell system. Your task is to help me set up a new writing project.

1. **Read the Agent Playbook**: Open and read `AGENT-PLAYBOOK.md` in this repository.

2. **Read the templates**: Familiarize yourself with:
   - `templates/project-manifest-template.md`
   - `templates/section-card-template.md`
   - `templates/context-manifest-template.md`

3. **Read the available lenses**: Look at `lenses/` to see what's available. Pay special attention to `lenses/night/` for my presets.

4. **Ask me clarifying questions** about this new project before creating anything:
   - What is this project? (blog, book, guide, essay series, etc.)
   - What's the core purpose or vision?
   - Who is the audience?
   - What constraints should we respect?
   - Which existing lenses should we use, or do we need new ones?
   - What's the rough scope or structure?

5. **After I answer**, create the project structure:
   - Create a new folder under `projects/` with an appropriate name
   - Create `PROJECT.md` based on the template, filled with my answers
   - Create `CONTEXT-MANIFEST.md` with appropriate priority tiers
   - Create `OUTLINE.md` with an initial structure (we can refine it)
   - Create `DECISIONS.md` (empty, with header)
   - Create `HANDOFF.md` (empty, with header)
   - Create `sections/` folder with initial section cards

6. **Output a summary** of what you created and recommend next steps.

## Example (ready to paste):

You are working inside the InkWell system. Your task is to help me set up a new writing project.

1. Read `AGENT-PLAYBOOK.md` for your behavioral instructions.
2. Read the templates in `templates/`.
3. Review available lenses in `lenses/night/`.

Here's what I know about the project so far:

**Project type**: Blog series

**Vision**: A series of posts explaining attachment theory to therapy clients and curious readers. Accessible, warm, clinically grounded.
**Audience**: Current and prospective therapy clients, people interested in psychology, fellow clinicians who want plain-language resources.
**Lenses**: night-core-lens, night-clinical-lens
**Rough structure**: Maybe 6-8 posts covering secure attachment, anxious attachment, avoidant attachment, disorganized attachment, how attachment forms, attachment in adult relationships, healing attachment wounds.

Please:
1. Ask any clarifying questions you have
2. Then create the project structure with all necessary files
3. Summarize what you created and recommend next steps
