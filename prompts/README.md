# InkWell Bootstrap Prompts

These are ready-to-paste prompts that properly initialize agent sessions. They are the primary interface between you and the InkWell system.

## How to Use

1. Copy the contents of the appropriate prompt file
2. Paste it into a new Cursor chat
3. The agent will follow the instructions to load context and begin work

## Available Prompts

### `writing-session.md`
Start a focused writing session on a specific section. Use this for most day-to-day work.

### `new-project.md`
Initialize a new writing project from templates. Use this when starting something new.

### `revision-pass.md`
Run a self-critique and revision pass on completed drafts. Use this to refine work.

### `recovery.md`
Get back on track when things have gone sideways. Use this if the agent seems lost or misaligned.

## Customization

Feel free to modify these prompts for your workflow. The key elements to preserve:
- Explicit instruction to read `AGENT-PLAYBOOK.md`
- Specification of which project and section to work on
- Request for pre-flight check before substantial work
