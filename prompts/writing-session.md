## Instructions for this session

You are working inside the InkWell system. Before doing anything else:

1. **Read the Agent Playbook**: Open and read `AGENT-PLAYBOOK.md` in this repository. This contains your behavioral instructions.

2. **Load project context**: Read the following files:
   - `projects/[PROJECT_NAME]/PROJECT.md`
   - `projects/[PROJECT_NAME]/CONTEXT-MANIFEST.md` (if it exists)
   - The active lens files listed in PROJECT.md
   - `projects/[PROJECT_NAME]/HANDOFF.md` (for session continuity)

3. **Load section context**: Read the section card for today's work:
   - `projects/[PROJECT_NAME]/sections/[SECTION_NAME].md`

4. **Output a pre-flight check** before doing any writing. Use the format from the playbook.

5. **Execute the task**: [DESCRIBE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO — e.g., "Draft the first section", "Revise for voice alignment", "Expand the outline"]

6. **After completing work**:
   - Update the Section Card with new status, decisions, TODOs
   - Write a handoff note to HANDOFF.md
   - Propose next steps

## Fill in before pasting:

- `[SECTION_NAME]` → the section you're working on (e.g., `welcome-post`)
- `[DESCRIBE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO]` → the specific task
